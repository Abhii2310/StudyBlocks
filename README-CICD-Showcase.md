# üöÄ CI/CD & Cloud Deployment Showcase

This project features a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** with cloud deployment to Render, ensuring every code change is built, tested, and deployed with zero manual steps.

## 1. Status Badges

![CI/CD Build](https://github.com/Abhii2310/StudyBlocks/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
![Postman API Tests](https://github.com/Abhii2310/StudyBlocks/actions/workflows/postman-api-test.yml/badge.svg)

These badges update automatically to show the health of your build and API tests.

## 2. Automated Workflow Steps

- **Build & Lint**: Runs on every push or PR to `main`.
- **Security Scan**: Snyk checks for vulnerabilities.
- **API Testing**: Newman runs the full Postman API collection to ensure backend correctness.
- **Artifact Upload**: Newman test results are archived for review.
- **Cloud Deploy**: If all tests pass, production is auto-deployed to Render.

## 3. How to Demo to Mam

1. **Push any code change to `main`** (even a comment).
2. **Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab**
   - Show the workflow running each step (build, test, API test, deploy).
   - Point out green checkmarks for each stage.
   - Show the ‚ÄúDeploy to Render‚Äù step.
3. **Show the Render dashboard**
   - Show the build logs and the live site URL.
   - (Optional) Add a "Deployed at: {date}" stamp in your app UI for proof.
4. **Show the badges in the README**
   - Explain what each badge means.
5. **Download and show the Newman API test report artifact**
   - Prove all APIs are tested automatically.

## 4. What to Say to Mam

> ‚ÄúEvery code change is automatically built, tested (including all backend APIs), and deployed to the cloud. 
> This ensures the project is always robust, up-to-date, and production-ready. No manual steps are needed!‚Äù

---

## 5. (Optional) Add a "Deployed At" Timestamp

In your frontend, add:
```js
<footer>Deployed at: {new Date().toLocaleString()}</footer>
```
This will update on every deploy, making it easy to prove the site is live and current.

**You are now ready to demo a modern, professional CI/CD + cloud deployment pipeline!**
